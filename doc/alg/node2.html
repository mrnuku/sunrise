0.1 Introduction</A>
</H1>
This document is a collection of common computing algorithms and their
implementations.  It was not originally meant to be a formal study in
the efficiency or analysis of algorithms but recently I have been
augmenting the discussion of the presented algorithms with formal
analysis.  This is by no means an all-encompassing collection of
algorithms.  Rather it is intended to be a cookbook of popular
algorithms, a discussion of how they work, and a collection of useful
implementations.

<P>
It is far from complete and contains many bugs.  I am actively working
on this collection in my spare time so, now and then, you will notice
changes.  Being that it is a work-in-progress, however, please excuse
any rough edges.  The wording of my descriptions needs polishing in
many places, the implementations given may be buggy, and the overall
content is not (and may never be) as complete as I would like.

<P>
This document is available as <A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="http://wannabe.guru.org/alg/alg.tar.gz">a bunch of HTML
files</A>
and
<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="http://wannabe.guru.org/alg/alg.ps">in Adobe Postscript format</A>.  This document is also available
in L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X_format but to run it through L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X_it you will need the
L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X2HTML style files included with that translator.  If you want
the original L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X, e-mail me.
