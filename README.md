# sunrise engine

This is my WIP game engine, parts based on Quake2 and Doom3 sources, keeping GTKRadiant fully compatible with patch support.

The renderer is rewritten by scratch on top of OpenGL 3.3, featuring a defered shading architecture.
SSAO and shadow mapping works well, but local lights still missing.

It uses the ODE physics engine, LUA scripting language and CEGUI ui system.
